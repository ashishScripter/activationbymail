= Installation =

You can use two methods to install activationbymail module:
 # Automatic
 # Manual

Automatic installation is more user friendly and does not require you to access your prestashop installation via FTP or SSH, I would recommend this installation method for non-technical users. If this method will fail to install module, please use manual installation.

Manual installation is more 'bullet proof' but requires some technical knowledge. It is a good installation method for people who has some technical knowledge and knows how to access prestashop installation via FTP or SSH.

== Automatic Installation Method ==

 # Go to Downloads section and choose version of the module that matches your prestashop version.
 # Download zip file to your local disk.
 # The name of the file should be activationbymail_YYYY_MM_DD.zip, where YYYY - year, MM - month, DD - day of the release.
 # Change the name of the downloaded zip archive from activationbymail_YYYY_MM_DD.zip to activationbymail.zip - basically you need to delete _YYYY_DD_MM. For example, if archive is named activationbymail_2012_09_19.zip you need to change file name to activationbymail.zip
