= Installation =

You can use two methods to install activationbymail module:
 # Automatic
 # Manual

Automatic installation is more user friendly and does not require you to access your prestashop installation via FTP or SSH, I would recommend this installation method for non-technical users. If this method will fail to install module, please use manual installation.

Manual installation is more 'bullet proof' but requires some technical knowledge. It is a good installation method for people who has some technical knowledge and knows how to access prestashop installation via FTP or SSH.

 # Go to Downloads section and choose version of the module that matches your prestashop version.
